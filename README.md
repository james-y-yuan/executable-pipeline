# Executables Hub

This repository contains three subfolders to aid in the creation of executable-based psychological experiments.
* `exe_demo` contains a full tutorial, with written and video instructions, on how to convert a sample PsychoPy experiment into an executable-based task, in about 30 minutes.
* `source_code` contains the source code for the PsychoPy experiment used in [our paper](https://psyarxiv.com/8a5hk).
* `stimulus_generator` contains a Python program which pre-generates image files of [VCS/CIELAB shape-color objects](https://osf.io/d9gyf/), for use in continuous visual precision experiments.
